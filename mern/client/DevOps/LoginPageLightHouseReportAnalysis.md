## Performance Analysis

**Performance Score: 56**

The performance score indicates that the page is slower than desired, affecting user experience and potentially leading to higher bounce rates.

### Key Metrics:

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 3.1 s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 5.6 s
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** 0 ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.103
- **Speed Index:** 3.2 s

### Issues and Recommendations:

1. **Enable Text Compression:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **4,861 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Configure server-side compression (e.g., Gzip or Brotli) to reduce the size of text-based resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. **Reduce Unused JavaScript:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **5,131 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Analyze the JavaScript bundles to identify and remove unused code. Tools like Webpack's Tree Shaking can help eliminate dead code.

3. **Minify JavaScript and CSS:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **1,345 KiB** in JavaScript and **21 KiB** in CSS.
   - **Recommendation:** Use minification tools to reduce file sizes. Minification removes whitespace, comments, and unnecessary characters without affecting functionality.

4. **Avoid Enormous Network Payloads:**
   - **Issue:** Total size was **6,359 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Optimize assets to reduce payload size. This includes compressing images, minifying code, and lazy-loading non-critical resources.

5. **Reduce Unused CSS:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **118 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Remove unused CSS selectors. Tools like PurgeCSS can help identify and eliminate unused styles.

6. **Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **15 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Use modern image formats like WebP or AVIF, which offer better compression rates without compromising quality.

7. **Properly Size Images:**
   - **Issue:** Potential savings of **21 KiB**.
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure that images are not larger than their display size. Resize images appropriately before serving them to the client.

8. **Image Elements Lack Explicit Width and Height:**
   - **Issue:** Can cause layout shifts.
   - **Recommendation:** Specify `width` and `height` attributes on `<img>` tags to help the browser allocate the correct amount of space while the image is loading.

9. **Avoid Large Layout Shifts:**
   - **Issue:** CLS of **0.103** and **3 layout shifts found**.
   - **Recommendation:** Reserve space for dynamic content and ads, and avoid inserting content above existing content unless necessary.

10. **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources:**
    - **Issue:** Potential savings of **80 ms**.
    - **Recommendation:** Defer non-critical CSS and JavaScript, and inline critical CSS to
