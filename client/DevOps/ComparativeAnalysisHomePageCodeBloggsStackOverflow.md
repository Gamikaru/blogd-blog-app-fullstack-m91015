**Issues and Recommendations for Codeblog:**

1. **Enable Text Compression:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **5,043 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Use server-side compression like Gzip or Brotli to reduce the size of text-based resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

2. **Reduce Unused JavaScript:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **5,055 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Remove unused JavaScript code and implement code splitting to load only necessary scripts.

3. **Minify JavaScript and CSS:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **1,420 KiB** in JavaScript and **21 KiB** in CSS.
   - *Recommendation:* Minify code to reduce file sizes without affecting functionality.

4. **Avoid Large Layout Shifts:**

   - *Issue:* CLS of **0.297** indicates significant visual instability.
   - *Recommendation:* Reserve space for images and dynamic content by specifying `width` and `height` attributes.

5. **Properly Size Images:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **11 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Serve images that are appropriately sized for their display dimensions.

6. **Image Elements Lack Explicit Width and Height:**

   - *Issue:* Causes layout shifts during page load.
   - *Recommendation:* Add explicit `width` and `height` attributes to `<img>` tags.

7. **Remove Duplicate Modules in JavaScript Bundles:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **25 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Eliminate duplicate dependencies in JavaScript bundles using tools like Webpack's Duplicate Package Checker.

8. **Avoid Serving Legacy JavaScript to Modern Browsers:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **11 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Serve modern JavaScript syntax to modern browsers using the `module`/`nomodule` pattern.

9. **Reduce Unused CSS:**

   - *Issue:* Potential savings of **115 KiB**.
   - *Recommendation:* Use tools like PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS selectors.

10. **Avoid Enormous Network Payloads:**

    - *Issue:* Total size was **6,599 KiB**.
    - *Recommendation:* Optimize all assets to reduce the total payload size, including compressing images and minifying code.

11. **Largest Contentful Paint Image Was Lazily Loaded:**

    - *Issue:* Affects LCP timing negatively.
    - *Recommendation:* Remove `loading="lazy"` from critical images to ensure they load promptly.

12. **Avoid Chaining Critical Requests:**

    - *Issue:* **56 chains found**, causing delays.
    - *Recommendation:* Reduce the depth of critical request chains by inlining critical resources and deferring non-critical scripts.

**Stack Overflow's Strengths:**

- **Fast Load Times:** Quick FCP and LCP indicate efficient rendering.
- **Zero CLS:** No layout shifts provide a stable visual experience.
- **Optimized JavaScript Execution:** Lower TBT suggests efficient script handling.
